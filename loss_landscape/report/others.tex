Within the original implementation, we found an interesting flag ``skip\_bn\_bias'' which is used for skipping batch norm and bias while computing the directions for projection and the loss landscape. 
We note that \cite{li2018visualizing} use this flag in their work without explanation. 
Thus, we wonder what could the loss landscape be like without this flag. 
Moreover, via this experiment, we shall see how the batch normalization layers keep the ``scale invariance'' property.
